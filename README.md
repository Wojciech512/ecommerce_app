## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project in your preferred development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Use your IDE's version control integration or run the following commands:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
     cd your-repo-name
     ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - Run the following commands in the terminal:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install the project dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory (if not already provided) with the following content:
     ```
     SECRET_KEY=your-django-secret-key
     DB_HOST=your-database-host
     DB_NAME=your-database-name
     DB_USER=your-database-user
     DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
     ```
   - Alternatively, configure environment variables directly in your IDE's run/debug configuration settings.

5. **Apply Database Migrations**:
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

6. **Run the Development Server**:
   - Start the server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```
   - By default, the application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

7. **Optional - Set Debugging**:

   - Enable **2-Step Verification** if it is not already active.

2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - After enabling 2-Step Verification, go to the [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) page.
   - Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" as the device, then give it a name (e.g., `Django App`).
   - Click **Generate**. A password will be displayed‚Äîcopy it securely.

3. **Set Up Your Environment Variables**:

     ```env
     EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-app-email
     EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password
     ```
   - Replace `your-app-email` and `your-app-password` with the account email and app password you generated in Step 2.

4. **Ensure Security**:
   - Do not commit the `.env` file containing sensitive information to your version control system.
   - Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to protect it.

By following these steps, your application will be able to send emails using your configured Google account.
